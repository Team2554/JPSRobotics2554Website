		For every successful team, there is an important "behind-the-scenes" process that glues
		everything together. Our students have worked with fantastic teachers, resourceful engineers,
		cooperative businesses, and friendly volunteers to become the effective group we are today. We
		do what we do not just because of our insatiable love of STEM, but to impact our community in a
		meaningful way so that it will eventually impact us. In this gallery, you will get a glimpse of
		who we are, what we have accomplished, what we have dealt with, and most importantly, what it
		means to be part of the JPS Warhawks!
